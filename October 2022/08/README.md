# Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting normal message into meaningless
message. Encrypt a given word using a given keyword while following the given
method of encryption: -We know that the English alphabets are of the format A,
B, C, D, E, F, G, H, …X, Y and Z, but here you will be provided with a keyword for
instances “APPLE” so you have to consider the unique letter in the given
keyword in the same order that is “APPLE” becomes “APLE”. Now this keyword
will take the initial positions of the letters in English alphabets thus shifting
others and finally we get A, P, L, E, B, C, D, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, N, O, Q, R, S, T, U, V,
W, X, Y and Z. Using this we can convert the word “HAPPY” as “FAOOY”, because
at the position of 'H' now we have 'F' and so on. So, the encrypted format of
word “HAPPY” is “FAOOY” using the keyword “APPLE”.

# Input format
