# Derivative Index of a string

A string S is said to be derivable from a string 'w' if

1) S is a substring of W.

For eg., S=bcd, W= abcde.

Here, we say that S is a derivative of W of level 0.

2). S is made up of a few symbols from W, without changing the order in which
the symbols appear in W.

S= abcd ; W = taxbyced.

Here the order of the symbols: a,b,c,d (these are the symbols that appear in S)
in S is the same as that of those symbols in W. By saying order of a,b,c,d is
same as in S and W', we mean like : If 'b' appears before 'a' in S, 'b' appears
before 'a' in W also.

Here we say that S is derivative of W of level 1

3) S is made up of symbols from W by changing the order in which they appear
in W.

For Eg. S=abcd; W=bsacd.

Here 'a' appears after 'b' in W, but, a appears before b in W.

Here, we say that S is aderivative of level 2.

#### Derivative Index:

If S is a derivative of W, we compute the derivative index as follows.

1. The derivative index is zero, for the derivatives of level 0 and 1.

2. The derivative index for the derivatives of level 2 is calculated as follows:

We denote by P<sub>W</sub>(a), is the the position index of the symbol a in W. If a occurs
in more than one position in W, P<sub>W</sub>(a) will be the position index with the
smallest index . If W=aabab, P<sub>W</sub>(a)=1 and P<sub>W</sub>(b) = 3.

If S is derivative of W of level 2, the derivative index = Σ<sub>a in S</sub>(P<sub>W</sub>(a) - P<sub>W</sub>(a).)

Eg. S= abcd W= btacd : Here

P<sub>S</sub>(a)=1, P<sub>S</sub>(b)=2, P<sub>S</sub>(c)=3, P<sub>S</sub>(d)=4; P<sub>W</sub>(a)=3, P<sub>W</sub>(b)=1, P<sub>W</sub>(c)=4, P<sub>W</sub>(d)=5

So, the derivative index = (3-1) + (1-2) +(4-3) + (5-4) = 2.

**Note** : If none of the symbols of S are in W, then we say that S is not a derivative
of W.

Given two words W and S, Write a code to compute the derivative levels ,
derivative index when S is a derivative of W and the derivative level, derivative
index when is aderivative of S.

If S is not aderivative of W (or W is not a derivative of S), your program should
print -1 and there is no derivative index for this.

#### Input format:

Enter the first Word S

Enter the second Word W 

#### Output format:

If S is a derivative of W,

output the level of the derivative

Output the respective derivative index

If S is not a derivative of W, Output -1.

If Wis a derivative of S:

output the level of the derivative

Output the respective derivative index

If W is not a derivative of S Output -1.
