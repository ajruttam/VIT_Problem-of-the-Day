# Minimum Number of Bits Required

Memory usage has to be minimized in an embedded system application, the
embedded system uses same number of bits to store all numbers of the
application. The programmer wants to use only the minimum number of bits
required for storing ‘n’ integers. Given a set of ‘n’ integers, write a C++ program
to find the minumum number of bits required to store each of the integer. For
example, if five integers 4, 16, 31, 23, 2 are to stored then the minimum number
of bits required to store each integer is 5.

#### Boundary Conditions

0<=x<= 922337203685477580 where ‘x’ is any value in the number

#### Input Format

First line contains the number of numbers used in the application, n

Next line contains the numbers of the application separated by a space

#### Output Format

Print the minimum number of bits required to store the numbers of the
application
