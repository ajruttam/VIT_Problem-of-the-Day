# Wet Will (testament)

A rich man of a city wrote a will (testament) to distribute his property to
his nine children. In addition to lands, houses and jewels, he had also
deposited some money in his bank account. The rich man passed away
one day and the properties were distributed to his children as per his
will. But a part of his will got wet in which one of the digit at some
position 'p' of the money that he deposited in his bank account got
erased. The rich man’s friend told that the amount (in rupees)
deposited by the rich man was such that it can be evenly distributed (in
rupees) to his nine children without leaving any remaining rupee(s).

For example, if the will contains ₹13456 then the missing digit is 8.

Given the amount written in the will without the missing digit at some
position 'p', write a C++ program to find the missing digit so that
maximum amount that could have been written on the will.
