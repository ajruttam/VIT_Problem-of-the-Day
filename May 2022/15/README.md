# Generate Third String

In an alphabet series with three strings of same length, the third string is
formed from the characters of the second string. The absolute difference of the
corressponding characters in position ‘i’ of S1 and S2 is added with characters
of S2 to form S3.

Given two strings S1 and S2 of equal length, write a C++ code to generate S3
such that S1, S2 and S3 are in alphabet series. For example, strings HEJ, JGL and
LIN are in alphabet series. If end of the alphabet is reached during processing
then continue from the beginning of the alphabet. That is if S1 is AYB and S2 is
BZC then S3 will be CAD.

#### Input Format

First line contains string S1

Next line contains string S2

#### Output Format

Print the string S3
