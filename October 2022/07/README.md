# Array Swapping

For a given integer n take two arrays as an input with n space separated values.
Iterate through both arrays and swap the elements such that all smaller
elements go to array1 and larger elements goes to arrray2. 

For example:-

If n = 5 and

Array1 = [1,4,2,0,7]

Array2 = [2,3,5,1,6]

Then after swapping we will be getting:-

Array1 = [1,3,2,0,6]

Array2 = [2,4,5,1,7]

#### Input format

First line takes the value of n.

Second line takes all the n elements of the array1 in space separated
format.

Third line takes all the n elements of the array2 in space separated format.

#### Output format

Print both arrays in two separate lines after swapping, all the elements of
each array should be printed in a single line in space separated format.
