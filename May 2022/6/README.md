# Blue and Red Stars in a Planetarium

Planetariums are an integral part of any society that values space exploration
and has an inherent inclination towards astronomy. India has not less that **30 planetariums** which can be found in almost all big cities of the country. Some
of the these are among Asia’s biggest and boasts of latest technologies. In
space, young stars are **blue** in colour and emit more **light** than older ones
which are red in colour. For fun, the head of a planetarium decides to display
few number of red and few number blue color stars for a few seconds as per
vistors’ wish.

When the visitor wants to have ‘n’ stars in total, he would display ‘x’ blue stars
and ‘y’ red stars where

(i) n, x, y are integers, x ≤ y

(ii) n = x+y, x and y are called addends

(iii) If ‘n’ is even, then product of x*y = x1*y1 – 9 and x*y = x1*y1-12 otherwise,
where x1, y1 are addends of ‘n’ which has the maximum product.

For example, if n is 10 then the number of blue stars is 2 and number of red
stars is 8. If n is 23 then the number of blue stars is 8 and the number of red
stars in 15.
