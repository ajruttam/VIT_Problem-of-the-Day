# Ticket Number that Yields Maximum Points

A college is conducting a series of cultural events by inviting celebrities. A
group of student volunteers are involved in organising the events. For each
event, a student wants to attend, he has to buy a ticket for the event by paying
the price mentioned by the organisers. To encourage the participation of
students the organisers have announced a type of discount. That is in each
ticket for event E1, a random value of point ‘p’ is printed and there will be
discount in the price of the ticket for event E2 based on ‘p’. Higher the value of
‘p’, higher the discount will be. When a group of ‘k’ friends come together to
buy the tickets, they will be given continuous ‘k’ tickets and they can choose the
starting ticket number.

Given the details of the tickets available and number of friends who have come
to buy the tickets write a C++ code to determine the first starting ticket number
which will yield maximum points for them.

For example, when there are totally nine tickets available and a group of three
friends have come to buy tickets and the details of the tickets(ticket number
and points) are as follows

10 1

11 2

12 3

13 1

14 4

15 5

16 2

17 3

18 7

They have to choose 16 as starting ticket number to yield maximum points.

#### Input Format

First line contains the total number of tickets available ‘n’ and the number of
friends in the group ‘k’ separated by a space

Next ‘n’ lines details on the tickets (ticket number and points printed on the
ticket) separated by a space

#### Output Format

Print the starting ticket number that will yield maximum points for the group of
friends
